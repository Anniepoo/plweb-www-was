---+ Creating a Windows console application from SWI-Prolog

If you want to use a SWI-Prolog program as a stand-alone *|.exe|*, you can
do this using qsave_program/2 or using the commandline. The command
below creates =|myapp.exe|= from =load.pl= and makes the program start at
main/0

==
swipl.exe -o myapp.exe -c load.pl --goal=main
==

To run, =|myapp.exe|= requires *|.dll|* files from the installation's
=bin= directory. The required *|.dll|* files are listed below. Note that
the details may depend on the version and installation. Notably
=|libdwarf.dll|= may not be present and the others may have a different
version.

  - =|libswipl.dll|=
  - =|libdwarf.dll|=
  - =|libgmp-10.dll|=
  - =|libwinpthread-1.dll|=
  - =|libgcc_s_seh-1.dll|=

Your application may depend on additional *|.dll|* files loaded through
use_foreign_library/1. You can find these with
current_foreign_library/2.

The required *|.dll|* files must be installed in the same directory as
the executable or in a directory available through =|%PATH%|=.

@see In many cases, it is way easier to start an application [from the Prolog source](<PrologScript.html>).
